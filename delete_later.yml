  dry_run: ^[[0;36mDry-run mode lets you test JellyDemon without actually applying bandwidth limits to users.
Instead of making real changes, the daemon will log what changes it WOULD make to the log file.
This is recommended for first-time setup to verify everything works correctly and see what
actions would be taken before enabling live bandwidth management.
You can disable this later once you're confident it's working properly.^[[0m
